# Footnote sorter demo

The text below has multiple footnotes that are all messed up. Footnote sorter will sort them for you.

You like hedgehogs[^1], right? Well, echidnas[^3] are like hedgehogs, but bigger and better. They're
also knkown as spiny anteaters[^4], and they're one of the only mammals
that lay eggs (the other
being a platypus). Pretty neat eh[^2]?

[^2]: super cool
[^1]: hedgehogs are cool, but echidnas are cooler.
and soon you'll see our mascot
[^3]: actually
    you can put complex stuff in the footnotes, like tabs
    /// tab | yo
    content
    ///
[^4]: What a name!
