Red deer[^1] are interesting as well.
The range is vast with red deer native to western Europe, western Asia, parts
of the Middle East, and even northern Africa[^2]!
There is a herd of roughly 3000 red deer living in The Netherlands'
Oostvaardersplassen [^3] (a nature reserve).
The male red deer are referred to as stag or hart [^1] whereas the females are
doe or hind and the young are calves.

The size [^4] of the red deer stags can rival that of North America elk if an
ample food supply is present. Red deer are the fourth largest[^5] extant deer
species behind moose, elk, and sambar deer.
