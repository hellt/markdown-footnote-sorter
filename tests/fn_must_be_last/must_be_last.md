Red deer[^red_deer] are interesting as well.
The range is vast with red deer native to western Europe, western Asia, parts
of the Middle East, and even northern Africa[^n_africa]!
There is a herd of roughly 3000 red deer living in The Netherlands'
Oostvaardersplassen [^nl_reserve] (a nature reserve).
The male red deer are referred to as stag or hart [^red_deer] whereas the
females are doe or hind and the young are calves.

The size [^desc] of the red deer stags can rival that of North America elk if
an ample food supply is present. Red deer are the fourth largest[^size] extant
deer species behind moose, elk, and sambar deer.
