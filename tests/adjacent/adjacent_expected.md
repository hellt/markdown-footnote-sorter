# Wrens

## Overview

Wrens [^1] [^2] are a family of brown birds of which there are 88 species.

## Size

Wrens are medium-small to very small birds. The Eurasian wren is among the
smallest birds in its range, while the smaller species from the Americas are
among the smallest passerines in that part of the world. [^3]

## Coloration

The dominating colors of their plumage are generally drab, composed of gray,
brown, black, and white, and most species show some barring, especially on the
tail or wings [^3].

## Diet

Wrens are primarily insectivorous, eating insects, spiders and other small
invertebrates, but many species also eat vegetable matter and some eat small
frogs and lizards [^1] [^2].

The Eurasian wren is the only species of wren found outside the Americas, as
restricted to Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. [^5]

The Eurasian wren has been recorded wading into shallow water to catch small
fish and tadpoles [^6] .

The most common call of the Eurasian is a sharp repeated "tic-tic-tic" [^7].
